Hi, I'm Jihyun, or you can call me Daisy!

I am currently working on my master's degree in Seoul National University, Department of Architecture and Architectural Engineering. My research interests are theoretical and practical aspects of graphic statics. I want to contribute to promoting collaboration between designers and structural engineers, which would lead to more construction projects on statics-based, material-efficient, and aesthetic structures. 
I am also interested in machine learning, optimization, and geometry processing techniques to manipulate the form and force diagrams of structures. 

The best way to contact me is by email: [brownie1465@snu.ac.kr](mailto:brownie1465@snu.ac.kr) !
